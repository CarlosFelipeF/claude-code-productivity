### 2. Question Extraction

- What problems are they wrestling with?
- What decisions are they stuck on?

### 3. Evolution Tracking
- How have ideas developed over time?
- What opinions have changed?
- What clarity has emerged?

### 4. Connection Finding
- What ideas relate to each other?
- What unexpected links exist?
- What patterns connect different entries?

### 5. Breakthrough Detection
- What "aha" moments are captured?
- What realizations stand out?
- What shifts in thinking occurred?
