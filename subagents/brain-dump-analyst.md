                    |   MAIN THEME     |
                    +--------+---------+
                             |
         +-------------------+-------------------+
         |                   |                   |
    +----+----+        +-----+-----+       +-----+-----+
    | Sub 1   |        |  Sub 2    |       |  Sub 3    |
    +---------+        +-----------+       +-----------+
```
